#Colle Major


My college Major is IT and below is some code that I have done in class:



import random
from turtle import Turtle

def recursive_lines_1(turtle, angle, length, delta):
    colors = ["red", "green", "yellow"]
    turtle.color(random.choice(colors))
    turtle.right(length)
    turtle.forward(angle)
    length = length - delta
    angle = angle + 15
    if (length > 1):
        recursive_lines_1(turtle, angle, length, delta)
        
def main():
    random.seed()
    ANIMATION_SPEED = 0
    Donatello = Turtle()
    Donatello.speed(ANIMATION_SPEED)
    recursive_lines_1(Donatello, 0, 100, 2)

main()
